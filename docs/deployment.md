# Deployment and Build

Deployment is highly customizable and can vary based on business needs.

## OOTB Deployment Idea

The general idea of OOTB deployment can be depicted by the below high-level diagrams, and it probably fits most business needs.

**Figure 1: API request direct to transaction and search servers. Currently used**

**Figure 2: API requests proxy from Next.Js server (Optional)**

In the above deployment, the static assets, e.g., images, are served from the web server. These can be served from a different location, such as your preferred CDN.

## Deployment Environment Variables

The deployment requires environment variables similar to what we have in `.env.local`. To ensure the proper functioning of the **Next.js** store, the following environment variables need to be set:

**Mandatory environment variables**

1. `SEARCH_ORIGIN`: The Search server origin that can be accessed within the deployment cluster, e.g., `https://www.search.com:30901`.
2. `TRANSACTION_ORIGIN`: The Transaction server origin that can be accessed within the deployment cluster, e.g., `https://www.commerce.com:5443`.
3. `MAP_API_KEY`: A Google Maps API key to be used by the store locator.

**Optional environment variables**

1. `LOG_LEVEL`
2. `LOG_CENSOR_STRING`
3. `TRACE_DETAILS`

All of the above are serviceability-related environment variables. Refer to [Overall Design](overall-design.md) for more details.

## Build

Please refer to our sample [Dockerfile](../bvt/docker-builds/app/Dockerfile) to create your Dockerfile.

To build the Docker image of your customized Commerce **Next.js** store, run `docker build ${PATH} -f ${PATH/TO/Dockerfile}`. For example, from the project root directory, run `docker build . -f bvt/docker-builds/app/Dockerfile`.

Note: The out-of-the-box (OOTB) Commerce **Next.js** Store server is a **Next.js** custom server (not a standard **Next.js** server) only accessible by HTTPS protocol.
